<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>200hr Indian Traditional Ashtanga and Hatha Yoga Teacher Training Course has a duration of total 30days(4 weeks). </strong>This is a basic yoga teacher training course where we prepare the students to have good knowledge about not only asanas but also yoga. Nowadays, people have given the meaning to Yoga as Asanas only and very rare people include pranayama&nbsp;in Yoga. But real meaning of Yoga seems to be getting disappearing these days. But, we here at Om Yoga in addition to Asanas and Pranayama, also teach real meaning of Yoga. Actually, in our vedas, ancient texts nowhere it is mentioned Yoga is asanas. So, we focus on what vedas says about Yoga(This is why we say we teach from the traiditonal pount of view). Try to familarize our students with the real meaning of Yoga. This helps them to understand about this path of Yoga and practice it in a much more better way. This lets our students to gain confidence so that if they go in any part of the world and talk to any person regarding yoga, they donot loose confidence and be firm in their knowledge and feel proud from inside that they have done a good course with Om Yoga as all our concepts are fully supported with the vedic mantras and also scientifically. We have gained a good experience in this path. It is our own experience , we see students who come to do Yoga at our centre have main focus of doing asanas only because they have made up their mind before coming here for yoga as asanas only but when we teach them the real meaning of yoga, how yoga includes 3 aspects: physical, mental and spiritual, they love listening to that. How Yoga can be helpful in our daily life,, how it can help a person to live a good and harmonius life. Most of them even feel surprised to liten to these types of talks and sometimes get so overwhelmed. All this they then try to implement&nbsp;in their life which helps them to live a happy and balanced life.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Another thing most of the people seen nowadays feel they cannot do Yoga because they have no flexible bodies or suffer from some physical problem. And so feel demotivated for doing Yoga. But we have planned our courses in a systematical manner that anyone can do these courses. Studies in Om Yoga touch totally therapy concepts which is easy for each and everyone to carry out irrespective of any physical problem. We have made different series of Asanas(around 6) , Pranayama(around 4) and philosophy too(Philosophy we teach from very basic level). Our series are designed very systematically from basic level to advanced level. We start teaching from basic series and week by week, slowly and gradually take to advanced series.&nbsp;In this method, even those people who have less flexibility or any physical problem, also can do easily without facing much exertion physically or mentally. And those who say we cannot do Yoga because of less flexibility they come to the point where they can even do advanced level too.This builds&nbsp;confidence in them&nbsp;upon what they have studied. As rather than touching the modern studies of Yoga, we start from very traditional concepts.This has been our experience since many years. This process that we teach is followed very rare people.&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size:18px"><strong><span style="color:#3498db">200 HOUR TEACHER TRAINING COURSE DETAILS:</span></strong></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong><span style="color:null">This course is divided into 5 Modules:</span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Practice (Physically, Mentally and Spiritually)</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Anatomy and Physiology of Yogic Practices</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Traditional Yogic Philosophy</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Yogic Lifestyle</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Teaching Methodology and Practice</li>
	<li style="text-align:justify">Evaluation</li>
</ol>

<p style="text-align:justify">We have framed a well organized structure of Yoga&nbsp;for our Yoga students to help them acheive better results in these 30 days. Each and every module has been thoughtfully designed to make it easy&nbsp;to understand and practice it in a well planned manner. The batches are led by our well experienced <a href="../../yoga-instructors.html">Yoga Instructors</a>&nbsp;. After this 30 days course, we gurantee that students leave our centre with enough knowledge about Yoga and also a changed perspective towards this practical life. The philosophy taught here&nbsp;helps them to understand life and lead a good&nbsp;life by inculcating positive thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This course helps you to have a detailed study about eight limbs of Ashtanga Yoga and 4 sections, basically 6 limbs of&nbsp;Hatha Yoga. At the end of these 30 days, we ensure that student becomes a good Yoga Teacher and helps him to walk in all path of life easily. In more detail, in this course we give much more emphasis on detailed study of Asanas, its adjustment, variations, benefits, limitations, way of doing, things to be careful while doing a specific asana and different style of doing one particular asana. Along with this, detailed study on Pranayama is also given that helps them to have a better concentration on breath. So, overall this course is a good begining for those who are beginners.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Specially, most of the people seen nowadays feel they cannot do Yoga because they have no flexible bodies or suffer from some physical problem. But here, Asanas and Pranayama taught here are totally in therapy style. We have framed different series of each asana and pranayama. For one asana, we have framed 6 series where 1st series start from basic and keeps on moving to advanced level with every level of series. No asana is taught directly in advanced level. Always we start from the basic level first. In addition to this, we teach&nbsp;each asana in&nbsp;4-4 or 3-3 steps. We reach final position of each asana in 4 steps and come back to initial position again in 4 steps. Same in Pranayama also. We have made around 4 series of each and every pranayama. Directly, we donot teach to apply bandhas. First step we develop the person practice inhale and exhale. Then, second step hold the breath with Ashtanga style. In third step, we teach how to hold the breath by applying bandhas in hatha style. Last step, we move towards external retention which is the most advnaced step for pranayama.Like this, our series are designed very systematically from basic level to advanced level. We start teaching from basic series and week by week, slowly and gradually take to advanced series.&nbsp;In this method, even those people who have less flexibility or any physical problem, also can do easily without facing much exertion physically or mentally. And those who say we cannot do Yoga because of less flexibility they come to the point where they can even do advanced level too.This builds&nbsp;confidence in them&nbsp;upon what they have studied. Like this, we proceed sequentially in the practice of asanas and pranayama. This has many benefits. One is this practice can be practiced by anyone irrespective of any physical problem too. Other, it follows therapy rules. and also it is good for beginners to start and pursue their practices in a easy and well mannered way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">This makes the practice and undertsanding easy for the beginners to carry out.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img alt="" src="../../upload/yogaphoto/files/pic%202(1).jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 300px;" /></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span style="color:#3498db"><strong>Practice</strong></span><br />
<strong>1) Asanas (Postures):</strong> You will learn to practice asanas in many different styles, the main is traditional Ashtanga and Hatha Style. Same Asana but how it differs when you practice&nbsp;the same&nbsp;in Ashtanga and Hatha style. Along with this, also you will get to learn some other styles like Iyengar Style, Vinyasa Style&nbsp;etc...</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Not only practice, but&nbsp;also you will learn about various asanas,their&nbsp;types,category and the technique of teaching the postures, the benefits and limitations of each posture, modifications, different mistakes generally made while doing them.You will learn to differentiate the meaning of asanas and exercise. The correct meaning of asanas will be clear here. And also what is the role of asanas in Yoga. You will learn here everything about asanas. How to connect asanas with breathing known as Vinyasa style. Here you will learn below mentioned styles:</p>

</ul>

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>2) Adjustment:</strong> Learn how to adjust these asanas and also master an asana in a much better way. And know how to correct the mistakes performed by our own and also people while doing the asanas. This is one of the most important aspect required while doing asanas.While doing or teaching one asanas, what points a teacher must focus upon while seeing the student doing the asana. And also how he or she should adjust and handle the student, way of touching, adjusting body part. What points must be focused upon? For that, we teach separately in our Asanas Philosophy session, how to adjust a particular asana. What points should be focused on? First, teacher demonstartes how to adjust. Then student is made to practice in front of teacher how to adjust others. Like this, full fledged practice is given.<br />
<strong>3) Pranayama (Breathing Techniques):</strong> Here you learn different breathing exercises, Pranayama meaning control over the pranas&nbsp;as you learn how to deepen your breath which in turn helps to relax your mind.

These techniques also helps in pranayama and meditation. Infact, these are said to be the preparation of Pranayama.<br />

I had a habit of taking drugs but after studying the course, i really changed my habits to Sattvic. Also, what we all use to feel that happiness is something that comes from outer world. Here, I learned what is true happiness? Now, i can say and can feel that i am very happy and can feel happiness from inside  and doesnot require outer things to keep me happy.</p>

Before 5 years, i suffered from Diabetes and due to this, i underwent a lot of stress. i could feel everytime i use to hide my real self. I could never express myself the way i am. This very thing always made me feel not good. After completing the yoga course, i was able to recognise and accept real me and could question myself as a neutral person. This was so superb that i started dealing with my problems so nicely. This was the first thing that helped me here to overcome my stress. The best lesson i learned in my Yoga course is Aparigraha. Have as much required. Ask yourself how much you require rather than working unconsciously.  I was able to manage my stress effectively.I was deeply benefitted by this program as i learned the right way of living a life.</p>

This course helped me to face myself deeply that how negative i am. But, yes this also helped me to become positive. Learning Yoga here helped me to learn to accept the things as they are. The best part of this course was i could meet Ruchika Sensei, whose lessons had a great impact on my mind. It was great and fantastic to take lectures of her. I would really love to take advance  course in the future here.  </p>

Now I know meditation is nothing but yoga. Everything I learned here, asana, meditation, pranayama, theory are very useful in a practical life.

But now, after completing the course, I can say clearly ,”Yoga is life” because yoga focuses on our body and mind and more than that, inner self. At last, I can only say that my life changed, and sparked by understanding Yoga, and meeting so nice Yoga teachers of OmYoga</p>

Here, I learnt how body, mind and breath are connected with each other. Yoga is not merely asanas. Doing asanas, by connecting mind with body helps in achieving better pose.  I learnt from here,"“Don’t make the problem bigger by yourself.” This is what I learned from teacher Ruchika Saran. “Be satisfied with what you have now.” “You become far from happiness if you are focusing on past or future.”
“Find happiness from where you are, be responsible for yourself, choose to be better.” These are golden things i have learned from here.

Before this, i did my course at other places before coming here : Patanjali University and In DU. But i was totally confused in yogic concepts. At some of the places, i even hurt myself while doing asanas because the way of teaching was so hard there. But as here i have completed my course, I am so happy that finally i know what is Yoga and how to implement it in my life. Because here, everything taught is from traditional concepts.</p>

          <div class="about-footer pb-3">
<div class="footer-logo" style="text-align:justify"><strong>OM YOGA &ndash; believes in making complete and perfect Yoga Instructor acc. to Yoga of Indian Traditiion.</strong> So, if you are looking for becoming a complete and perfect Yoga instructor, then you are at a right place. Yoga which was born in India in Sanskrit language many centuries before whose date and time cannot be specified as it is present since the beginning of this universe, whose base was Ashtanga Yoga and Hatha Yoga written in Patanjali Yog Darshan, Hatha Yog Pradipika, Gheranda Samhita, Siva Samhita etc. is a very deep knowledge like an ocean. It is so deep that nothing in this world is impossible with Yoga. The impossible word here signifies whatever requirements human being has in this world like respect, position, health, wealth, success, love, beauty, fearless, physically and mentally strong, peace, bliss, in overall all achievements on this planet that human being wants to have , there is nothing that cannot be achieved through Yoga. &nbsp;<strong>There is no word like Impossible with Yoga because Yoga means UNION which means becoming one. And this is practically experienced by our Yogis.</strong> And this is the reason why people travel to India to study Yoga specifically as India has gained its special position in this world with the name of Yoga, and has also been declared as, &rdquo;World Guru&rdquo;.<br />
But, we can see that in this present time there are more than thousands of Yoga centres all over the India who say that they teach Yoga but seeing in reality, we can feel and see that traditional yoga is getting lost because modern people who are coming forth in this field themselves have no actual understanding about Yoga as they cannot study Sanskrit language so, unable to understand real Yoga. So, these people have restricted the meaning of Yoga only to Asanas. After Asanas, people do not go beyond because they do not there is something beyond this also. Which is totally wrong. Yoga is something different. It is a complete path in itself. Asanas is just one part of Yoga but not a complete path. So, it can be seen Yoga has just become a fun in present time. If we talk to people for Yoga, they have only two things to speak about, one is regarding Asanas and another how to cure diseases that is therapy. Nothing beyond this. So, it is very pathetic to see how Yoga is loosing its real meaning.<br />
<strong>We, here at Om Yoga focus on this real Indian Traditional Yoga along with Sanskrit language present the same to people in English.</strong>(we have facilities for the translator for those people who have problem in understanding English). This makes our place unique place to study Yoga which is rarely available in other places. And we have succeded in achieving 99% results in spreading this knowledge. Our students feel this thing after they come to Om Yoga. They say that they had no idea Yoga is something beyond asanas also. They understand the real meaning of Yoga here and specially come to teach Traditional Yogic concepts here with us. And feel happy while they leave the centre. Our Traditional Yogic concepts help them in changing their life and come out of stress. For more info, you can visit our page of <a href="../../yoga-student-review.html">STUDENT REVIEWS</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>We can see that present time has become a very struggle full time for human being to survive on this planet because of increasing competition and desires and instability in relationships and emotions.</strong> To fulfil his desires and to be ahead in the race of competition, he is working day to night to achieve that and has just become like a machine where he has just forgotted the words like happiness, joy, calmness, relaxation etc.. But still when he is unable to fulfil his desires, he feels unsatisfied. Because if seen in reality, there is no end to desires. Desires are unlimited and no one ever can make the desires fulfilled. But we never understand this and are keen on fulfilling them. And when unable to fulfil, feel sad and unsatisfied, Because of that he gets demoralized and turns negative. This negative thinking then brings him under peer pressure feeling himself responsible for not being able to do what he wants. This then results in a lot of stress, tension, depression and anxiety. Now, when he is full of stress and anxiety, unable to sleep properly, then to come out of all this, he chooses an other path to make mind calm. For that, he starts taking a drink, smoke, drugs etc... Slowly and gradually, he becomes addicted to all this. The result of all this is that the person then suffers physically also. Because this path is not a permanent and correct way to get out of stress. But, because of lack of understanding at that time, he is unable to understand all this.
